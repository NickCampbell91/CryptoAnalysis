# Overview

Using a dataset found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/philmohun/cryptocurrency-financial-data) and using Pandas my intention is to analyze the price changes of various crypto currencies to see where it would be safest to invest. Everyone should have some money in crypto currencies, as even a few dollars invested at the right time can potentially have exponential gains.

# Data Analysis Results

What crypto currencies would be the safest investments based on the dataset and what should be avoided entirely.

Bitcoin and ethereum should be safe but tether should be avoided.

# Development Environment

VSCode

Python 3.7

# Future Work

* Splitting the datasets into smaller pieces to analyze how long I should expect a currency to rise and fall would be interesting. 
* Do an analysis with more information (columns) that could be used to predict changes.
